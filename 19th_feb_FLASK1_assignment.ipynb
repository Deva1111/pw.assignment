    "#Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, providing a solid foundation\n",
    "for building web applications. Flask follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, but it is flexible enough to \n",
    "allow developers to use different patterns based on their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advantages of using the Flask framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: Flask has a minimalistic design and a small core that makes it easy to understand and get started with. It provides \n",
    "               just the essentials for building web applications without imposing too many restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lightweight: Flask has a small footprint and does not require much in terms of dependencies or overhead. This makes it suitable  \n",
    "                for developing small to medium-sized applications or prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: Flask gives developers the freedom to choose the components and tools they want to use. It does not enforce any \n",
    "                particular database or template engine, allowing developers to work with their preferred technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extensibility: Flask provides a modular structure that allows developers to add or remove components as needed. It has a large\n",
    "                  ecosystem of extensions and libraries, which can be easily integrated to add functionality like database integration,\n",
    "                  authentication, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Pythonic: Flask is built with Python and follows the principles of the Python programming language. This makes it intuitive and familiar\n",
    "             for Python developers, leveraging their existing knowledge and skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Testing: Flask provides a built-in test client that makes it easy to write unit tests for your application. It also integrates well\n",
    "            with popular testing frameworks, making it easier to ensure the quality and reliability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Documentation and Community: Flask has excellent documentation that covers all aspects of the framework. It also has a vibrant \n",
    "                                community of developers who actively contribute to its development and provide support through forums,\n",
    "                                tutorials, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask is a powerful and versatile framework that strikes a balance between simplicity and flexibility. It empowers developers\n",

    "#Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "''''\n",
    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of defining routes within a Flask application. Routes define the URLs or paths that a \n",

    "by a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routes are essential in Flask because they determine how the application responds to different URLs or paths. By defining routes,\n",
    "you can map specific URLs to specific functions or views in your application. When a user visits a particular URL, Flask uses the defined\n",
    "routes to determine which function should handle the request and generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes are created using the `@app.route` decorator in Flask. The decorator allows you to specify the URL pattern or path that triggers \n",
    "the associated function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using app routes provides a way to organize and structure your Flask application. You can define multiple routes for different URLs,\n",

    "to handle various requests and generate different responses based on the accessed URL.\n",
