    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of programs that involve multiple tasks, especially those that involve\n",
    "input/output operations or tasks that can be executed concurrently. By using multiple threads, a program can perform several tasks\n",
    "at once, which can result in faster execution times and improved overall performance.\n",

    "The `threading` module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a way to create and manage threads, as well as to\n",

    "3. `enumerate()`: This function returns a list of all currently active thread objects in the program. It can be useful in debugging \n",
