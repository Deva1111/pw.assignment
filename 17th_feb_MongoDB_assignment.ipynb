    "#Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented format. It is designed to handle unstructured,\n",
    "semi-structured, and structured data with ease. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB does not use tables, rows, or columns to \n",
    "store data, but rather it uses collections and documents. Each document is a JSON-like object that can contain any number of fields\n",
    "with a wide range of data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not follow the traditional relational database model. In \n",
    "contrast to SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema and can store unstructured and semi-structured data with \n",
    "ease. NoSQL databases can be divided into several categories, including document-oriented databases, key-value stores, column-family \n",
    "databases, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented database and is preferred in scenarios where there is a need to store large amounts of unstructured\n",
    "data that may not have a fixed schema. It is also ideal for applications that require high scalability and high performance. Some \n",
    "of the use cases where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases include social media platforms, e-commerce applications, content\n",
    "management systems, and real-time analytics systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary advantages of MongoDB over SQL databases is its flexible data model, which allows for easy and efficient scaling.\n",
    "It also supports automatic sharding, which enables it to distribute data across multiple servers to handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "Additionally, MongoDB provides a rich set of features such as indexing, replication, and aggregation, which make it a popular choice\n",
    "for modern web and mobile applications.\n",

    "#Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that provides several features that make it a popular choice for modern web \n",
    "and mobile applications. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible data model: MongoDB's flexible data model allows for easy and efficient scaling. It supports unstructured and semi-structured\n",
    "   data with ease and allows for the storage of complex data types such as arrays, embedded documents, and geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automatic sharding: MongoDB supports automatic sharding, which allows it to distribute data across multiple servers to handle\n",
    "   large amounts of data. This ensures high scalability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing: MongoDB provides a rich set of indexing options that allow for fast and efficient query execution. It supports both \n",
    "   single-field and compound indexes, as well as text indexes for full-text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Aggregation: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing and analysis. It includes\n",
    "   a wide range of operators and stages that allow for data transformation, filtering, and grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Replication: MongoDB supports replica sets, which provide high availability and data redundancy. Replica sets are a group of \n",
    "   MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, allowing for automatic failover in case of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Schema-less: MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema, which means that documents within a collection can have different fields \n",
    "   and data types. This allows for easy and flexible data modeling, especially when dealing with unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which allows for easy integration with web and mobile applications.\n",
    "   The document-oriented model also allows for fast and efficient data retrieval, as the entire document can be retrieved in a single query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible platform for storing and processing data, making it a popular choice for modern \n",
    "web and mobile applications. Its rich feature set and high scalability make it well-suited for a wide range of use cases, from \n",
    "social media platforms to real-time analytics systems.\n",
