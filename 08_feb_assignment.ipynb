    "   adheres to certain standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Access Modifiers: Access modifiers are keywords used to define the level of access to a class's properties and methods. \n",
    "   In Python, the access modifiers are implemented through naming conventions. For example, if we prefix a variable or method \n",
    "   name with a single underscore, it indicates that it is a protected property or method, and if we prefix it with two \n",
    "   underscores, it indicates that it is a private property or method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Getters and Setters: Getters and setters are methods that are used to access and modify the values of a class's properties.\n",
