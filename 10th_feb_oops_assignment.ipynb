    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read mode (`'r'`)**: This is the default mode when opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of the file. If \n",
    "   the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`. Example: `open('filename.txt', 'r')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write mode (`'w'`)**: This mode is used when you want to write or overwrite the contents of a file. If the file exists,\n",
    "    its previous content will be discarded. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. Example: `open('filename.txt', 'w')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Append mode (`'a'`)**: This mode is used when you want to append new data to the end of an existing file. If the file\n",
    "     doesn't exist, a new file will be created. Example: `open('filename.txt', 'a')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Binary mode (`'b'`)**: This mode is used to handle binary data, such as images or executable files. It is combined with\n",
    "     other modes, like `'rb'` for reading a binary file or `'wb'` for writing a binary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update mode (`'+'`)**: This mode allows you to both read and write to a file. It is combined with other modes, like `'r+'`\n",
    "    for reading and writing, or `'a+'` for appending and reading. Note that using update mode can be more complex and requires careful handling to avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exclusive creation mode (`'x'`)**: This mode is used to create a new file, but it raises a `FileExistsError` if the file\n",
    "     already exists. It is often combined with write mode, like `'xw'`, to create a new file for writing.\n",
    "\n",

    "#Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The `close()` function is used to close a file that has been opened using the `open()` function or any equivalent file-opening\n",
    "method provided by a programming language. It is important to close a file after you have finished using it for several reasons:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates system resources to handle the file operations.\n",
    "     This includes memory resources, file handles, and other internal structures. Closing the file releases these resources, \n",
    "     ensuring efficient resource management. If you don't close the file properly, it can lead to resource leaks and potentially \n",
    "     exhaust system resources, causing issues with other file operations or overall system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Integrity**: Closing a file ensures that all the data you have written or modified is properly flushed and saved to\n",
    "     the underlying storage device. When you write or modify data in a file, it is typically buffered in memory before being \n",
    "     written to the disk. Closing the file forces any remaining buffered data to be written to the disk, ensuring that all changes\n",
    "     are persisted. If you don't close the file, some data may remain in the buffer and not be written, leading to data loss or inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Locking**: In some operating systems, when a file is open, it may be locked to prevent simultaneous access from \n",
    "     multiple processes or threads. By closing the file, you release the lock, allowing other processes or threads to access \n",
    "     and modify the file if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Good Programming Practice**: Closing a file explicitly is considered good programming practice and promotes code readability \n",
    "     and maintainability. It clearly indicates the end of file usage and helps avoid confusion or potential issues when dealing with large or complex codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some programming languages or environments automatically close files when they are no longer in use or when the program\n",
    "terminates, it's still a good practice to explicitly close files to ensure efficient resource utilization and data integrity.\n",

    "#Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The `with` statement in Python is used in conjunction with the `open()` function to ensure proper handling of files. When you\n",
    "use the `with` statement with `open()`, it automatically takes care of opening and closing the file, even if exceptions occur\n",
    "during file operations. Here's why the `with` statement is beneficial when used with `open()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Resource Management**: The `with` statement guarantees that the file will be properly closed after you finish\n",
    "     working with it, regardless of how the block of code exits (whether normally or due to an exception). It automatically \n",

    "     leaks and ensures efficient resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clean and Readable Code**: By using the `with` statement, the code becomes more readable and concise. It clearly delineates\n",
    "     the scope of the file operation and makes it evident that the file will be automatically closed after the block of code \n",
    "     is executed. This improves code readability and maintainability, especially in cases where multiple file operations are performed\n",
    "     within nested blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Safety**: If an exception occurs within the `with` block, the `with` statement ensures that the file is properly\n",
    "     closed before propagating the exception. This prevents leaving the file in an inconsistent state and helps maintain data\n",
    "     integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Common Errors**: Forgetting to close a file can lead to resource leaks and potential issues in file handling. \n",
