    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) relies on certain assumptions for its applicability. The assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence: The random variables being combined or averaged should be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one variable should not influence\n",
    "   the outcome of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identically Distributed: The random variables should have the same probability distribution. Although the specific distribution is not required to be normal, the \n",
    "   variables should have the same mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finite Variance: The random variables should have a finite variance. This assumption ensures that the variability of the individual variables is not too extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adequate Sample Size: The CLT works best when the sample size is sufficiently large. Although there is no hard and fast rule for what constitutes a \"large\" sample \n",
    "   size, a commonly recommended guideline is that the sample size should be greater than 30. However, in some cases, the CLT can still provide reasonable approximations\n",
    "   with smaller sample sizes, especially if the underlying distribution is not heavily skewed or has light tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that violating these assumptions may affect the extent to which the CLT holds. If the assumptions are not met, the convergence to a normal \n",
    "distribution may be slower or may not occur at all. In such cases, alternative methods or modifications to the CLT may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, while the CLT is powerful and widely applicable, it does not imply that the underlying population follows a normal distribution. It simply states that the\n",
    "distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, irrespective of the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is crucial to consider the assumptions of the CLT and assess their validity in the context of the specific data and analysis at hand.\n",
