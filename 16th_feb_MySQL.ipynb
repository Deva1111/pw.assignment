    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, \n",
    "manipulation, and management of data. Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, including web applications,\n",
    "mobile applications, business applications, and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two types of databases that differ in their underlying architecture and data storage models.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a structured approach to data storage and retrieval. They store data in tables that are made up of rows \n",
    "and columns, with each row representing a record and each column representing a specific attribute or field of the record.\n",
    "SQL databases are typically used for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and a high degree of data \n",
    "consistency and integrity. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases use a non-relational approach to data storage and retrieval. They store data in a \n",
    "flexible and unstructured way, using documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. NoSQL databases are typically used for \n",
    "applications that require high scalability, performance, and availability, as well as the ability to handle large amounts of\n",
    "unstructured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are their data storage models, with SQL databases using a\n",
